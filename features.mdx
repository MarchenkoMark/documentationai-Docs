## Version Control and History Tracking

Mark Marchenko tracks every change automatically. You view full history, compare versions, and restore previous states with a click.

Access history via the page menu (**...** > **View History**). Diffs highlight additions (`+`), deletions (`-`), and modifications.

Search across all pages with full-text indexing. Filters refine results by tags, date, or author.

|-------------|-------------|---------|
| Tags | Match labeled content | `api`, `v2.0` |
| Date Range | Recent changes | Last 7 days |
| Author | Specific contributor | `@john.doe` |
| Type | Pages, snippets, comments | Pages only |

Use advanced operators like `"exact phrase"` or `AND/OR`.

<Callout kind="info">
  Keyboard shortcut: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>K</kbd> opens global search instantly.

  ```
  ```bash
  # Full workspace HTML
  mark export --workspace=project --format=html --zip=true
  ```
</CodeGroup>
